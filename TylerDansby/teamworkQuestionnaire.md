# Teamwork Questionnaire for Tyler Dansby

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text. Anytime, although I may not respond until later in the day. Cell: (575)-551-2914
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * At the very least, everything that is asked of us. I'm hoping that we work well together.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I'm looking to learn a lot from my teammates, and getting better at explaining things myself.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Conflicting times if we need to meet up to get something done, but we'll figure out what works for everyone.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If I'm not mistaken, we don't all get the same grade so this shouldn't be an issue. Although if it turns out to be, I think that person should just change their standards for the sake of the team. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Sure, assuming we don't all get the same grade. If we do though, we'll have to sort that out.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Probably at least like 15 hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We'll just talk about it as a group. I don't necessarily think one person should decide all of that.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Depends on the situation, but if they simply chose not to do it we'll probably need a group meeting.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If someone is right, we'll likely learn something from it. If it's purely opinion-based then we'll just have to move past it.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * It shouldn't be a big issue as long as people do their work.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I don't think that should be necessary. We should probably have a group text chat though. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Twice a week, maybe more.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Majority rule.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Minority rights.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Again, talk about it at a team meeting. We shouldn't be hesitant to bring things such as this up because it will probably end up hurting us all in the end.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Talk to my team about it the next time we have a chance.
