Teamwork Questionnaire for Eli
    1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else? What hours? 
          Anything works, I can be reached pretty much all the time through anything
    2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester? 
          I’d like to complete all the assignments that we need to, that’d be pretty neat
    3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester? 
          Do things in a more timely manner and communicate better what needs to be done.
    4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals? 
          Possibly the difficulty of the assignments, but mainly video games and general apathy.
    5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable? 
          Then we’ll try for an A but in the end it’s not really up to me or the team sooo.
    6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”? 
          In a perfect world everyone should be doing the same amount of work.
    7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful? 
		      I’m not sure, but I’ll put in as much time as necessary to make it successful.
    8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities? 
		      Discuss it with the team member and use our strengths to our advantage.
    9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)? 
          Figure out why we missed it and plan so that doesn’t happen again in the future.
    10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work? 
          Then we’ll probably have to get it up to everyone’s standards so one person doesn’t drag the team down
    11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members? 
          Idgaf what you do as long as it gets done
    12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class? 
          If that’s what the group wants sure, I’m pretty flexible with everyone’s needs/wants.
    13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class? 
          Depends on how the first parts of the project go and how well we end up communicating through other means.
    14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision? 
          Whatever the team wants to do I’ll be happy to work with it
    15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something? 
          Listen to why they don’t agree and promptly ignore them...jk, but listen and see if we can compromise to make everyone happy
    16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process? 
          Then we’ll tell them to chill out and let us do something
    17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you? 
          Talk to the team about it and delegate more of my responsibilities to them
