## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* Responsive Client for Distance Calculator 
* RESTful Service for distance 

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* N/A

#### What went well
* We finished it in a resonable time 
* Got along well with eachother, little to no conflict. 

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Understanding server-client communication 
* UNderstanding where to get input from server and JSON objects 

## Retrospective

#### What went well
Teamwork, non-conflictive, finishing the task. 

#### Potential improvements
*Communication, punctuality. With how late we recieved the sprint 1 sepcifications, it made it hard to plan to meet. We need to work on this next time and have better time managment and punctuality as so we are not working on the asignment only the day or two before its due. 

#### What we will change next time
