# Sprint 1 - t10 - Error 404: Team Name Not Found

## Goal

### Distance Calculator!
### Sprint Leader: Eli Harris 

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (black-bottle.cs.colostate.edu).
* Version in server/pom.xml should be `<version>1.0</version>`.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint#.md).
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub.

## Policies

* All commits include a task/issue number.
* No commits to master.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* Responsive Client for Distance Calculator.
* RESTful Service for distance.

All we had planned out was to meet at somepoint before Thursday and figure it out together, only a bit of work was done outside this half-day session. Much more planning will be needed in the future for bigger projects. 

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* Responsive Client for Distance Calculator.
* RESTful Service for distance.

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* N/A

#### What went well
* We finished it in a resonable time.
* Got along well with eachother, little to no conflict.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Understanding server-client communication.
* UNderstanding where to get input from server and JSON objects.

## Retrospective

#### What went well
Teamwork, non-conflictive, finishing the task. How we split up the tasks and code worked out well and used everyones strengths to make it go as smooth as possible. 

#### Potential improvements
Communication, punctuality. With how late we recieved the sprint 1 sepcifications, it made it hard to plan to meet. We need to work on this next time and have better time managment and punctuality as so we are not working on the asignment only the day or two before its due. 

#### What we will change next time
Considering these projects are only getting bigger and more complicated, more planning and more meetups will be necessary. A more descriptive/complex distribution of workload than just a task or two per person.
