1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to complete our projects on time and do well in the course. I also hope to learn an extensive amount about web development and engineering enviroments.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I hope to learn how to colloborate with those I am unfamiliar with and work cooperatively to complete projects in a timely manner. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I had a large problem with procrastination and time managment last couple of semesters. I will improve this semseter with the help of my team and own personal efforts. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * There will have to be comprimises on both sides no matter the occasion.  An A is always preferrable, no matter who you are. But if the group is mostly or all B students, then expectations must be realistic. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Sometimes work will be delegated incorrectly or parameters were overlooked as a simpler task. Communication must be kept between members. If one member believes they are working too much, we can talk about it and delgate the work better in the future.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * However much is necessary, I am willing to work everyday like previous semesters if the project requires it. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Discussion between members work should be assigned based off skills, preferences, time availibility and necessity. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Depending on the context, the "manager" may be contacted or it will be dealt with internally. Either way it will not be ignored. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * As with previous questions, compromises will need to be made. As long as the project meets all reqiurments, quality can be argued and discussed. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Discussion is key. Not much else to say. We can all work in different ways as long as the product prodcued represents quality and effort. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * If it fits everyones schedules without interffering with work flow or other classes, yes. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * As often as necessary. I expect everyone to be working mutiple times a week on this, if we need to meet to get this accomplished the so be it.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If it is a large enough decision, yes. Optimization, readibility, minor improments or previously discussed topics will not need apporval. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * As stated previously, comprimises are absolutely necessary. If one member is unwilling to compromise, conflict resolution tactics will be needed. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Team discussion will be used, if unfruitful; the "manager" will be contacted. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will ask for assistance from my team members to better delegate the work. If the team is unresponsive or resistent, "management" may need to be contacted.
