### Antonio Segovia Maldonado
Antonio is an undergraduate student on his fourth year and majoring in Applied Computing Technology. He currently works for the CSU Engineering Network Services (ENS) as a Support Assistant. He is also working on the redesign of the ENS website as a front-end and back-end developer. In his free time, he is an avid and casual cycler and spends time reading fiction or playing video games. He loves to cook; for the most part, he usually spends every evening cooking dinner, especially when it comes to perfecting his own take on bolognese. He owns a cockatiel parrot and a parakeet, who are both temporarily staying with his parents due to a change in new residence and pet restrictions.

# Manifesto
*Introductory Paragraph Here*

### Clean, Simple, and Efficient Work
As developers contributing to the same projects, it is essential that our work is not only readable and easy to understand, but also quick and to the point. This includes and is not limited to our code, written reports, and communication logs. Given that each person has their own way of thinking and implementing code, our work must be clean and simple so as to allow other team members to implement and coordinate with their portion of the work with ease. Adhering to this value will save us considerable time and prevent unncessary confusion between team members, potential clients, and anyone implementing our work in future projects.
