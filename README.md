### Antonio Segovia Maldonado
Antonio is an undergraduate student on his fourth year and majoring in Applied Computing Technology. He currently works for the CSU Engineering Network Services (ENS) as a Support Assistant. He is also working on the redesign of the ENS website as a front-end and back-end developer. In his free time, he is an avid and casual cycler and spends time reading fiction or playing video games. He loves to cook; for the most part, he usually spends every evening cooking dinner, especially when it comes to perfecting his own take on bolognese. He owns a cockatiel parrot and a parakeet, who are both temporarily staying with his parents due to a change in new residence and pet restrictions.   
 
### Tyler Dansby
Tyler is a third year student in Computer Science at Colorado State University, planning to graduate in 2020. He just started a Data Entry job at Anderson Podiatry Center in Fort Collins, primarily scanning documents and using excel and word to keep track of data and send out letters to patients. He is still unsure of what route he wants to take with his degree but is excited about the range of options. He enjoys playing a variety of video games in his freetime, as well as watching movies and TV shows. Having built a desk and a lightsaber replica the past year, both with little to no prior experience in woodworking and soldering/wiring, he almost always finds a creative outlet.

### Nick Kaliher
Nick is a Junior Computer Science major. He is currently a full time student at CSU and plans to graduate in 2020. Nick enjoys playing video games and watching a variety of forms of media. He has an interests in artifical intelligence and wishes to return to CSU after some years in industry to get a masters degree. Outside of class activities include hanging out with friends, rockclimbing, and hiking. 

### Eli Harris 
Eli is a Senior Applied Computing Technology major aspires to graduate in the Spring of 2019. Eli participates in many activities including but not limited to taking bad photos of scenery, binge watching whatever Netflix tells him to, buying video games but never actually playing them, and being overly sarcastic. He’ll probably become a sysadmin or a technical consultant one day. Eli also works alongside Antonio at as Support Technician at Engineering Network Services. One day he looked at the website Antonio is building and said “Neat.” 


# Manifesto

### Intro 
Our team will follow some simple guidelines to ensure that we are as productive, effcient and punctional as we can be. In this manifesto we detail how we'll strive towards making our code as clean, simple and efficient as possible. How we'll aim towards being punctual with regards to our assignments. Rules for communicatating important and not-so-imortant things to team members and others. Finally, this manifesto also shows how we'll be sensible with coding, approaching problems and questions about these problems.

### Clean, Simple, and Efficient Work
As developers contributing to the same projects, it is essential that our work is not only readable and easy to understand, but also quick and to the point. This includes and is not limited to our code, written reports, and communication logs. Given that each person has their own way of thinking and implementing code, our work must be clean and simple so as to allow other team members to implement and coordinate with their portion of the work with ease. Adhering to this value will save us considerable time and prevent unnecessary confusion between team members, potential clients, and anyone implementing our work in future projects.   

### Punctuality
It is critical for the team to produce clean and effiecient code in a timely manner. Not only should punctality be implemented throught the assignment turn in times, but also through teammate communication. The team should be quick and responsive to the others' questions. 

### Communication
It is impossible to have synergy in a team without good communication. Not only in describing how we add or change parts of the code, but what our intentions and goals are beforehand. Getting a solid idea of who will be focusing on what at which times will greatly reduce stress and wasted time. If a teammate has a problem and needs help, they should feel free to ask the others as they have likely run into a similar issue.

### Sensibility 
When developing our code, we must practice coding in a way that others can easily understand. Doing this will help the group maintain code that anyone can easily work on to help work on problems quickly and make it easier to evaluate where a proogram goes wrong. This also extends to asking for help on problems that arise. By asking team mates and piazza before using the TA's or even Dave's limited amount of time we can help reserve our most vauble resources before we burn them out with our questions. 


# Expectations
Although everyone has different styles in coding and thinking, team members are expected to follow clean code principles. 

For any major changes that will potentially affect the work of another, the editor is expected to at least notify everyone of their change and assign someone to approve their changes in GitHub.

In general, all team members are expected to follow the manifesto and all the values within it; as well as github etiquette and the CSU Conduct Guidlines.
