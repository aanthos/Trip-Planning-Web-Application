### Antonio Segovia Maldonado
Antonio is an undergraduate student on his fourth year and majoring in Applied Computing Technology. He currently works for the CSU Engineering Network Services (ENS) as a Support Assistant. He is also working on the redesign of the ENS website as a front-end and back-end developer. In his free time, he is an avid and casual cycler and spends time reading fiction or playing video games. He loves to cook; for the most part, he usually spends every evening cooking dinner, especially when it comes to perfecting his own take on bolognese. He owns a cockatiel parrot and a parakeet, who are both temporarily staying with his parents due to a change in new residence and pet restrictions.
