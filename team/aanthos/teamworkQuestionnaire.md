# Teamwork Questionnaire for Antonio Segovia Maldonado

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Faster to reach me by text whenever.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect my team will accomplish cooperating well and placing in the same amount of effort per person.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * With these types of projects, I usually only take leadership roles when necessary, but this time, my personal goals for improving these skills are to take a more active role in the team and in general, speak more when I have ideas or questions.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * The obstacles I may encounter might be how well each team member gets along with one another and how much each person is willing to trust another/how much effort someone is willing to put in.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If this is the case, I think directly talking with each other would probably be best. I think instead of focusing on the grade, we should be focusing on trying as best as we can.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I don't think this is acceptable as this may penalize the other members, and since this is a team assignment, it would be unethical.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Not too sure what to expect; maybe around ten hours per week
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We can talk and see who is comfortable doing what and decide from there. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We will probably need to get together and discuss how we can prevent this from happening again. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Again, we will need to get together to talk about this reasonably. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * If some stuff works for others, then so be it. As long as we're able to communicate what was done or needs doing effectively, it should be fine.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * If it's necessary. I'm fine with out of the blue meetings too as long as they don't happen too late in the evening. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I'm not too sure yet, but I think we'll meet as much as necessary.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Sure, that's what I usually do in projects. I think it's good to let everyone know what I'm up to.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Talk it out. If the reason they disagree with it is because there's a better and more efficient way, then sure. I'm more concerned with getting things done efficiently.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk to everyone about better dividing up tasks.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I will talk to everyone and figure out how to spread out responsibilities better.
