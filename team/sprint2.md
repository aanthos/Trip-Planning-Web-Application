# Sprint 2 - t10 - Error 404: Team Name Not Found

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *firstname lastname*

## Definition of Done

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint2.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

*An introductory paragraph describing what you expect to accomplish this sprint with a list of epics that will achieve the goal.*

* ## Tripco: All clients and servers must interoperate!
    * This requires an adherence to the TFFI specification.
    * Each client must include a configuration option to change to server:port used for RESTful services.
* ## TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices.
    * Mobile first! The solution should be designed/optimized for a mobile environment, but still work well in a desktop    environment. Not the other way around.
    * This is an ongoing issue that you might want to reflect in your README and sprint#.md's 
* ## User: I want to supply my own units for the distances.
    * An arbitrary unit of measure should be able to be defined to use in the itinerary.
* ## TripCo: All code shall be clean!
    * Adhere to the Google style guide for Java and JavaScript.
    * Write maintainable code.
    * Read the book.
    * Amends to the sprint2.md and README.md will be necessary to stay adaptive. 
* ## User:I want a map and itinerary for my trip
    * Trips in the state of Colorado are tested on another tool.
    * The tool produces a file that conforms to the TFFI trip object.
    * The trip is always a round trip.
    * Show a map and itinerary for the trip in the file that can be viewed on a phone.

*Include a discussion of planning decisions.*
