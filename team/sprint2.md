# Sprint 2 - t10 - Error 404: Team Name Not Found

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: Nick Kaliher

## Definition of Done

* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint2.md).
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Increment deployed for demo and testing.
* Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
#### Configuration Management
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 


## Plan

For Sprint 2 we expect to complete all of the epics in our backlog as well as maintain clean and efficient code in the process. Working on the project in small increments each day will help us achieve this goal and do it in a timely manner. As always, this will require good communication between all team members to decide the best times to meet during this Sprint.

* ## Tripco: All clients and servers must interoperate!
    * This requires an adherence to the TFFI specification.
    * Each client must include a configuration option to change to server:port used for RESTful services.
* ## TripCo: The solution must be responsive for mobile devices.
    * Mobile first! The solution should be designed/optimized for a mobile environment, but still work well in a desktop    environment. Not the other way around.
    * This is an ongoing issue that may need to be reflected in the README and sprint2.md. 
* ## User: I want to supply my own units for the distances.
    * An arbitrary unit of measure should be able to be defined to use in the itinerary.
* ## TripCo: All code shall be clean!
    * Adhere to the Google style guide for Java and JavaScript.
    * Write maintainable code.
    * Read the book.
    * Amends to the sprint2.md and README.md will be necessary to stay adaptive. 
* ## User:I want a map and itinerary for my trip
    * Trips in the state of Colorado are tested on another tool.
    * The tool produces a file that conforms to the TFFI trip object.
    * The trip is always a round trip.
    * Show a map and itinerary for the trip in the file that can be viewed on a phone.
    
During the discussion of our plan, we agreed to divide the workload under each epic into tasks that we believed would take under one hour each to complete. If we find that one task will take longer than we expected, we will divide the task further. Additionally, we will add or adjust tasks as needed while the project progresses. We will maintain good communication and regularly check in with each other on our progress regularly.
