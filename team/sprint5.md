## Goal

### Wrap It Up!
### Sprint Leader: Nick Kaliher

## Definition of Done

* Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name.
* Epics and Tasks updated in Zenhub.


## Policies

#### Test Driven Development
* Write method headers, javadoc, unit tests, and code in that order for all methods/functions.
* Unit tests are fully automated.
* Code coverage is at least 50%, 70% preferred.
#### Clean Code
* Code Climate maintainability of A or B.
* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
#### Configuration Management
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* All tests pass.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
#### Continuous Integration / Delivery
* Travis successfully builds and tests on all pull requests for master branch.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.  Do not load external libraries in your repo. 
* All pull requests are deployed on the development server.
* The development server is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.


## Plan

With this final sprint, we first hope to quickly finish the few epics that were leftover from sprint 4. We nearly completed sprint 4, so we should be left with a lot of time afterwards to focus our attention on delivering a complete and well-presented product by the end of this sprint. To accomplish this, we will collablorate with each other to finish epics in a timely manner, just as we did with the world map in sprint 4. Our main focuses will be the user interface, searching and adding places worldwide, the interactive map, and even shorter trips and trip planning times.

##### -Server Hierarchy

Our diagrams haven't changed since Sprint 4 because we expect the overall structure of the frontend and backend to remain relatively unchanged. As for the user interface, we are going to continue the same general structure for that as well, continuing where we left of with it in Sprint 4.

##### Epics planned for this sprint:

* User: I want to choose what information is displayed in the itinerary and map.
* User: I want to view my trip in other tools.
* User: I want to plan trips worldwide.
* User: Make the system easier to use.
* User: I want my options remembered so I don't have to fix them all the time.
* User: I want to know who to thank for this application.
* User: I want an interactive map.
* User: I want trip planning to be fast.
* User: I want the shortest trips possible.


## Metrics

| Statistic | Planned | Completed |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Epics | 9 | *total* |
| Tasks | 15 | *total* | 
| Story Points | 33 | *total* |

We are at a solid number of epics, tasks, and story points here for a start. We could definitely spread the work out more, but we won't really know until we start getting into these epics and tasks that we currently have to see what they really entail. This is how it usually goes for us, and it works out nicely in the end.


*Enter the `# Completed` at the end of the sprint.  Include a discussion about any difference in the number planned versus completed tasks and story points.*

## Retrospective

*An introductory paragraph for your retrospective.*

#### What we changed this sprint

*Articulate specifically what you will do differently based on the retrospective from the previous sprint before the sprint starts.*

#### What we did well

In this project, we learned how to communicate as a team even through disagreements. This lead to a better understanding of who does what well and who has certain stregnths in certain areas compared to others. We were able to finish our optimization and produce a clean code. Although our test coverage wasn't the best it was still well within the range needed. 

#### What we need to work on

Even though there where improvements among team moral, there were still certain communication issues and other deveopment aspects. We reached a certain level for testing but did not exceed in this asepct. There were some github areas that could be improved; like backlog maintenence and prioritzation. 

#### What we will change next sprint 

A large area of improvment for our team would be test coverage and certain aspects of github etiquette. Our backlog orginization was lacking and could of been followed better. Next sprint we will bring up our test coverage and follow a more procedural method with the backlog.
